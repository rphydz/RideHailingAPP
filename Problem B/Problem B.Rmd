# Data Cleaning and Processing
![](https://shorturl.at/EMQW6)

Removed rows that have a “Status if Order: Completed” but has no Total CBV, because it will affect the integrity and analysis of data.

Also removed rows with “0” # of orders but has completed, canceled, no drivers found, and Other/Failed/Timeout status because it will skew the analysis of data and create confusion because there’s no basis of the CBV.

In the case of Other/Failed/Timeout: Bug in the system with 0 values on # of orders. Its somewhat relevant to the analysis of data.

After removing irrelevant rows for data analysis, there were 2,769 rows left from the original uncleaned data of 3,211. A total of 442 rows removed.

After that I replace blank values in the Total CBV column and replace it with the value 0, in order to create analysis and visualization.

In this Bar-Chart, shows the total sum of Cash Booking values from the various Status of orders. Looking at a business perspective, potential CBV Loss can be analyzed if we take the total values from Cancelled, Failed/Timeout, No Driver Found, and Other which approximately $197 Billion.

In addition to visually analyze the data, I added a slicer to further see specific values from the Status of Orders.
