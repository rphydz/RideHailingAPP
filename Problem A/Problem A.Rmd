# Data Cleaning and Processing
![](https://shorturl.at/isHU1)

The first step is to clean and process the data. I transposed the data in Excel from rows to columns for better analysis. The dataset was then restructured to include three columns: Date, User Type, and Total. Afterward, I uploaded the data into Tableau for further analysis and visualizations.

# Figure 1: User Type Recorded per Month (Pie Chart)

#### Figure is generated using Tableau
In the first figure of visualization, shows the User type Recorded per Month. With this figure represented in pie chart, we can get the picture of how the flow users use the app and it composes of percentage and summation of information from the users recorded including their total from the following 5 months.

# Figure 2: Total User Types (Bar-Chart)

In this figure, illustrate the total users in the app. With this figure, we can start to draw insights about the users and the app. Based on this figure, there is a high record of total users who signed up. And the least recorded are Total active users.

**Problem**: 

The Ridehailing App is challenged between the escalating number of users who sign up for the service and a disproportionately low count of active users. Despite a growing record in user signups, user who requested a booking, and user who phone verified there exists an evident gap in converting sign-ups into sustained and active users with the application.

**To Answer the question: What actions would you commit to fix the problem based on this data?**

-	To address the problem using the data and insights here are some actions that might fix the problem.
o	Commit to implementing a comprehensive plan that will consistently focuses on the growth of users.
o	Analyzing user behavior, on how and when they mostly used the apps per time of the day, season of the year, and overtime.

Considering the analytical goals to answer the following questions for analysis:
1.	Pick up your most high priority task and create stories for development.

***In conclusion, to answer the question:***

What will you track to measure the success of your features/implementation?
